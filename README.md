Chat Application (TCP Client)
This is a simple chat application using Qt and TCP sockets. The application allows users to send and receive messages over a TCP connection. The custom TCP-like packet format includes various header fields such as source port, destination port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, data offset, flags, checksum, and more. The received packets are parsed, and the message data is displayed in the chat window.

Features
Establishes a TCP connection with the server.
Sends custom TCP-like packets with message data.
Receives and parses incoming TCP packets.
Displays only the message data (payload) in the chat window.
Extracts and displays TCP header information (sequence number, acknowledgment number, flags, etc.) in the debug log.
Prerequisites
Qt Framework: Make sure to install the Qt framework to run the application.
C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler that supports Qt (e.g., GCC or MSVC).
Server: The server must be running to accept incoming connections. You can use any TCP server for testing, but it should match the packet format of this client.
Installation
Clone or download the project.
Open the project in Qt Creator.
Build and run the project by clicking on the "Run" button in Qt Creator.
Ensure the server IP and port are correctly entered in the UI.
Usage
Starting the Application:
Enter the server IP and server port in the respective input fields.
Click the Connect button to establish a TCP connection with the server.
Type your message in the message input box and click Send to send the message to the server.
The message is sent as a custom TCP packet. The server’s response (if any) will be displayed in the chat history.
Message Format:
Source Port: The client's source port (e.g., 12345).
Destination Port: The server's port (entered by the user).
Sequence Number: Incremented with each message sent.
Acknowledgment Number: The acknowledgment number from the last received message.
Data Offset: The size of the TCP header in 32-bit words (e.g., 5 corresponds to 20 bytes).
Flags: TCP flags (SYN, ACK, PSH, etc.).
Window Size: Set to a fixed value (e.g., 1024).
Checksum: Calculated checksum for the TCP packet.
Urgent Pointer: Set to 0 for simplicity.
Debugging:
Debug Logs: The application outputs detailed debug logs, including the full TCP header details and any extracted fields like the data offset and flags.
Data Offset: The data offset is extracted from the high nibble of the 13th byte of the TCP header.

TCP Packet Structure
This application uses a custom TCP-like packet structure. Here is the breakdown of each field in the TCP packet:

Field	Size (Bytes)	Description
Source Port	2	The source port of the client
Destination Port	2	The destination port (server's port)
Sequence Number	4	The sequence number (incremented with each sent message)
Acknowledgment Num	4	The acknowledgment number (updated with each received message)
Data Offset	1	The data offset (in 32-bit words) from byte 13
Flags	1	The flags field, containing TCP flags (e.g., ACK, PSH)
Window Size	2	The size of the receive window (set to a fixed value)
Checksum	2	The checksum field for the packet
Urgent Pointer	2	The urgent pointer (set to 0)
Data	Variable	The actual message data (payload)

Troubleshooting
Connection issues: Ensure that the server is running and reachable.
Packet format mismatch: The packet structure used in this client must match the server's expected format. Verify the server is also using the custom TCP-like packet format.
Data offset: The data offset should be correctly extracted from byte 13. If you are seeing incorrect values, check the server's packet construction logic.
